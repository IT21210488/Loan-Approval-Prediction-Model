Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning | Guided Project

I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of machine learning by applying it to a real-world problem: predicting loan eligibility.
Dataset: I used a publicly available dataset of historical loan applications , containing over 600 records with features like applicant income, Gender, Marital status, employment status, and loan amount.
